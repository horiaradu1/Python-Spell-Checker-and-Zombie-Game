Hello, my name is Horia Gabriel Radu and I am the person that made this game

This game is about a zombie hoarde invasion in which you have to kill as many zombies as you can in the allocated time
The goal is to get the biggest score
For each zombie kill you will get 1 score and 1 extended second to the timer
Don't forget to reload, you only have 10 shots in a mag

The controls are the following:
-w,a,s,d for moving
-space for shooting
-r for reloading
-p for pause
-Esc for pause menu
-b for the boss key
-F11 for fullscreen mode
-type "time" or "score" on the keyboard while playing for the cheatcodes

Note: To save your score in the leaderboard you need to input a username
Note: To access a specific save file you have to use the same username with which the save file was made, otherwise it will go into a common save file that has no username

I hope you will have fun
Thanks for your attention and also thank you very much for playing!!
